# PowerScrambler
A tool that will take a PowerShell script that is known malicious. Encrypt it on your local system so it can be moved to a victim system. You will then run the decryption function which will decrypt an execute in memory bypassing AV... AMSI might catch you depending on the host based AV in use. We provide a way to turn off and bypass AMSI.
